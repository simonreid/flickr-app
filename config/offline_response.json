The titanic supernova, called Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A), blazed with the power of 100 million suns for several months following its discovery on Feb. 23, 1987.\n\nSince that first sighting, SN 1987A has continued to fascinate astronomers with its spectacular light show. Located in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, it is the nearest supernova explosion observed in hundreds of years and the best opportunity yet for astronomers to study the phases before, during, and after the death of a star.\n\n&quot;The 30 years' worth of observations of SN 1987A are important because they provide insight into the last stages of stellar evolution,&quot; said Robert Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in Palo Alto, California.\n\nThe latest data from these powerful telescopes indicate that SN 1987A has passed an important threshold. The supernova shock wave is moving beyond the dense ring of gas produced late in the life of the pre-supernova star when a fast outflow or wind from the star collided with a slower wind generated in an earlier red giant phase of the star's evolution. What lies beyond the ring is poorly known at present, and depends on the details of the evolution of the star when it was a red giant.\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2lEgs8M\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2lEgs8M</a>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

In February 1997, astronauts installed STIS on the telescope during the second servicing mission. The highly versatile and productive instrument combines a camera with a spectrograph, which separates light into its component colors—or wavelengths — to provide a “fingerprint” of the object being observed. This tells us about the object’s temperature, chemical composition, density, and motion. Spectrographic observations also reveal changes in celestial objects as the universe evolves. STIS has also pioneered the field of high-contrast imaging—the art of capturing faint objects (such as planets, disks, and outflowing jets) next to very bright ones (such as the stars they accompany). The instrument is sensitive to a wide range of wavelengths of light, from ultraviolet through the optical and into the near-infrared. STIS science has illuminated a multitude of different astronomical topics. Below are some examples, but this is not meant to be an exhaustive list.  \n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2lA1DEf\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2lA1DEf</a>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

Through NASA’s partnership in the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, the team observed the comet at infrared wavelengths a few days after Lovejoy passed its perihelion – or closest point to the sun.\n\nThe team focused on Lovejoy’s water, simultaneously measuring the release of H2O along with production of a heavier form of water, HDO. Water molecules consist of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. A hydrogen atom has one proton, but when it also includes a neutron, that heavier hydrogen isotope is called deuterium, or the “D” in HDO. From these measurements, the researchers calculated the D-to-H ratio – a chemical fingerprint that provides clues about exactly where comets (or asteroids) formed within the cloud of material that surrounded the young sun in the early days of the solar system. Researchers also use the D-to-H value to try to understand how much of Earth’s water may have come from comets versus asteroids.

We can detect these scars today by observing the oldest light in the universe. As it was created nearly 14 billion years ago, this light — which exists now as weak microwave radiation and is thus named the cosmic microwave background (CMB) — permeates the entire cosmos, filling it with detectable photons.\n\nThe CMB can be used to probe the cosmos via something known as the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) effect, which was first observed over 30 years ago. We detect the CMB here on Earth when its constituent microwave photons travel to us through space. On their journey to us, they can pass through galaxy clusters that contain high-energy electrons. These electrons give the photons a tiny boost of energy. Detecting these boosted photons through our telescopes is challenging but important — they can help astronomers to understand some of the fundamental properties of the universe, such as the location and distribution of dense galaxy clusters.\n\nThe NASA/ESA (European Space Agency) Hubble Space Telescope observed one of most massive known galaxy clusters, RX J1347.5–1145, seen in this Picture of the Week, as part of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). This observation of the cluster, 5 billion light-years from Earth, helped the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile to study the cosmic microwave background using the thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect. The observations made with ALMA are visible as the blue-purple hues.\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, T.

While this lovely image contains hundreds of distant stars and galaxies, one vital thing is missing — the object Hubble was actually studying at the time!\n\nThis is not because the target has disappeared. The ACS actually uses two detectors: the first captures the object being studied — in this case an open star cluster known as NGC 299 — while the other detector images the patch of space just ‘beneath’ it. This is what can be seen here.\n\nTechnically, this picture is merely a sidekick of the actual object of interest — but space is bursting with activity, and this field of bright celestial bodies offers plenty of interest on its own. It may initially seem to show just stars, but a closer look reveals many of these tiny objects to be galaxies. The spiral galaxies have arms curving out from a bright center. The fuzzier, less clearly shaped galaxies might be ellipticals. Some of these galaxies contain millions or even billions of stars, but are so distant that all of their starry residents are contained within just a small pinprick of light that appears to be the same size as a single star!\n\nThe bright blue dots are very hot stars, sometimes distorted into crosses by the struts supporting Hubble’s secondary mirror. The redder dots are cooler stars, possibly in the red giant phase when a dying star cools and expands.\n\nCredit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, explain that electric fields drive the ionosphere, which, in turn, are predicted to set up enhanced neutral winds within an aurora arc. This experiment seeks to understand the height-dependent processes that create localized neutral jets within the aurora.\n\nFor this mission, two 56-foot long Black Brant IX rockets will be launched nearly simultaneously. One rocket is expected to fly to an apogee of about 107 miles while the other is targeted for 201 miles apogee.

This image taken by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows the star going through a rapid transformation from a red giant to a planetary nebula, during which it blows its outer layers of gas and dust out into the surrounding space. The recently ejected material is spat out in opposite directions with immense speed — the gas shown in yellow is moving close to one million kilometers per hour (621,371 miles per hour).\n\nAstronomers rarely capture a star in this phase of its evolution because it occurs within the blink of an eye — in astronomical terms. Over the next thousand years the nebula is expected to evolve into a fully-fledged planetary nebula.\n\nThe nebula is also known as the Rotten Egg Nebula because it contains a lot of sulphur, an element that, when combined with other elements, smells like a rotten egg — but luckily, it resides over 5,000 light-years away in the constellation of Puppis.\n\nCredit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt \n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

Astronomers are still debating on how to classify it. While its physical properties — such as mass, size and rotational velocity — indicate it to be a spiral galaxy, its appearance looks more like a comet with its dense, luminous “head” and dimmer “tail” trailing off. Features more fitting with a dwarf irregular galaxy.\n\nAlthough small and messy, galaxies like NGC 4861 provide astronomers with interesting opportunities for study. Small galaxies have lower gravitational potentials, which simply means that it takes less energy to move stuff about inside them than it does in other galaxies. As a result, moving in, around, and through such a tiny galaxy is quite easy to do, making them far more likely to be filled with streams and outflows of speedy charged particles known as galactic winds, which can flood such galaxies with little effort.\n\nThese galactic winds can be powered by the ongoing process of star formation, which involves huge amounts of energy. New stars are springing into life within the bright, colorful ‘head’ of NGC 4861 and ejecting streams of high-speed particles as they do so, which flood outwards to join the wider galactic wind. While NGC 4861 would be a perfect candidate to study such winds, recent studies did not find any galactic winds in it.\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA"},"o_width":"1280","o_height":"1024","dateupload":"1485532647","lastupdate":"1486373841","datetaken":"2017-01-23 06:00:00","datetakengranularity":"0","datetakenunknown":"0","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"24424","tags":"ngc4861","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"a135035068","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/32174703260_e859a1d06c_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/32174703260_e859a1d06c_t.jpg","height_t":"80","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/32174703260_e859a1d06c_m.jpg","height_s":"192","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/32174703260_e859a1d06c_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/32174703260_e859a1d06c.jpg","height_m":"400","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/32174703260_e859a1d06c_n.jpg","height_n":256,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/32174703260_e859a1d06c_z.jpg","height_z":"512","width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/32174703260_e859a1d06c_c.jpg","height_c":640,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/32174703260_e859a1d06c_b.jpg","height_l":"819","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/335/32174703260_a135035068_o.jpg","height_o":"1024","width_o":"1280","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"32524105455","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"e5f831edc6","server":"373","farm":1,"title":"Apollo 1 crew in training","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"The prime crew of Apollo 1, Virgil I (Gus) Grissom, Edward H.

The region is rendered in exquisite detail — deep red and bright blue stars are scattered across the frame, set against a background of thousands of more distant stars and galaxies. Two features are particularly striking: the colors of the stars, and the dramatic crosses that burst from the centers of the brightest bodies.\n\nWhile some of the colors in this frame have been enhanced and tweaked during the process of creating the image from the observational data, different stars do indeed glow in different colors. Stars differ in color according to their surface temperature: very hot stars are blue or white, while cooler stars are redder. They may be cooler because they are smaller, or because they are very old and have entered the red giant phase, when an old star expands and cools dramatically as its core collapses.\n\nThe crosses are nothing to do with the stars themselves, and, because Hubble orbits above Earth’s atmosphere, nor are they due to any kind of atmospheric disturbance. They are actually known as diffraction spikes, and are caused by the structure of the telescope itself.\n\nLike all big modern telescopes, Hubble uses mirrors to capture light and form images. Its secondary mirror is supported by struts, called telescope spiders, arranged in a cross formation, and they diffract the incoming light. Diffraction is the slight bending of light as it passes near the edge of an object. Every cross in this image is due to a single set of struts within Hubble itself! Whilst the spikes are technically an inaccuracy, many astrophotographers choose to emphasize and celebrate them as a beautiful feature of their images.\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

At first glance, this galaxy appears to be a normal spiral galaxy, much like the Milky Way, but first appearances can be deceptive!\n\nThe Milky Way galaxy, like most large galaxies, has a supermassive black hole at its center, but some galaxies are centered on lighter, intermediate-mass black holes. RX J1140.1+0307 is such a galaxy — in fact, it is centered on one of the lowest black hole masses known in any luminous galactic core. What puzzles scientists about this particular galaxy is that the calculations don’t add up. With such a relatively low mass for the central black hole, models for the emission from the object cannot explain the observed spectrum. There must be other mechanisms at play in the interactions between the inner and outer parts of the accretion disk surrounding the black hole. \n\nCredit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

National Weather Service forecasters expect light to moderate lake effect snow showers to continue throughout the day today and into Saturday (1/7).\n\nLake-effect snow forms when cold air passes over the warmer waters of a lake. This causes some lake water to evaporate into the air and warm it. This warmer, wetter air rises and cools as it moves away from the lake. When it cools, it releases that moisture and, if it’s cold enough, that moisture turns into snow.\n\nAlthough true-color images like this may appear to be photographs of Earth, they aren't. They are created by combining data from the three color channels on the VIIRS instrument sensitive to the red, green and blue (or RGB) wavelengths of light into one composite image.

NASA missions will also have to make the switch, including the Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, which watches the sun 24/7.\n\nClocks do this to keep in sync with Earth's rotation, which gradually slows down over time. When the dinosaurs roamed Earth, for example, our globe took only 23 hours to make a complete rotation. In space, millisecond accuracy is crucial to understanding how satellites orbit.\n\n&quot;SDO moves about 1.9 miles every second,&quot; said Dean Pesnell, the project scientist for SDO at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. &quot;So does every other object in orbit near SDO. We all have to use the same time to make sure our collision avoidance programs are accurate. So we all add a leap second to the end of 2016, delaying 2017 by one second.&quot;\n\nThe leap second is also key to making sure that SDO is in sync with the Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC, used to label each of its images. SDO has a clock that counts the number of seconds since the beginning of the mission. To convert that count to UTC requires knowing just how many leap seconds have been added to Earth-bound clocks since the mission started. When the spacecraft wants to provide a time in UTC, it calls a software module that takes into consideration both the mission's second count and the number of leap seconds — and then returns a time in UTC."},"o_width":"2001","o_height":"1619","dateupload":"1483112124","lastupdate":"1483732127","datetaken":"2016-12-30 09:46:33","datetakengranularity":0,"datetakenunknown":"1","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"28077","tags":"","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"5a30f9ef8b","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/404/31834258342_99f6da33f2_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/404/31834258342_99f6da33f2_t.jpg","height_t":"81","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/404/31834258342_99f6da33f2_m.jpg","height_s":"194","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/404/31834258342_99f6da33f2_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/404/31834258342_99f6da33f2.jpg","height_m":"405","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/404/31834258342_99f6da33f2_n.jpg","height_n":259,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/404/31834258342_99f6da33f2_z.jpg","height_z":"518","width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/404/31834258342_99f6da33f2_c.jpg","height_c":648,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/404/31834258342_99f6da33f2_b.jpg","height_l":"829","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/404/31834258342_5a30f9ef8b_o.jpg","height_o":"1619","width_o":"2001","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"31943461646","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"5c968d8d9a","server":"474","farm":1,"title":"TWITTER - 2016 Goddard Rewind.mp4","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"2016 Goddard Rewind - only use for twitter (lower quality without .srt for platform purposes)"},"o_width":"1920","o_height":"1080","dateupload":"1483106443","lastupdate":"1485311201","datetaken":"2016-12-30 06:00:43","datetakengranularity":0,"datetakenunknown":"1","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"29879","tags":"","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"9d0e92af62","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"video","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/474/31943461646_5c968d8d9a_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/474/31943461646_5c968d8d9a_t.jpg","height_t":"56","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/474/31943461646_5c968d8d9a_m.jpg","height_s":"135","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/474/31943461646_5c968d8d9a_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/474/31943461646_5c968d8d9a.jpg","height_m":"281","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/474/31943461646_5c968d8d9a_n.jpg","height_n":180,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/474/31943461646_5c968d8d9a_z.jpg","height_z":360,"width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/474/31943461646_5c968d8d9a_c.jpg","height_c":450,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/474/31943461646_5c968d8d9a_b.jpg","height_l":"576","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/474/31943461646_9d0e92af62_o.jpg","height_o":"1080","width_o":"1920","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"31587664700","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"705b21bb0c","server":"368","farm":1,"title":"Hubble Gazes at a Cosmic Megamaser","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"This galaxy has a far more exciting and futuristic classification than most — it hosts a megamaser. Megamasers are intensely bright, around 100 million times brighter than the masers found in galaxies like the Milky Way. The entire galaxy essentially acts as an astronomical laser that beams out microwave emission rather than visible light (hence the ‘m’ replacing the ‘l’).\n\nA megamaser is a process that involves some components within the galaxy (like gas) that is in the right physical condition to cause the amplification of light (in this case, microwaves).  But there are other parts of the galaxy (like stars for example) that aren’t part of the maser process.\n\nThis megamaser galaxy is named IRAS 16399-0937 and is located over 370 million light-years from Earth. This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image belies the galaxy’s energetic nature, instead painting it as a beautiful and serene cosmic rosebud. The image comprises observations captured across various wavelengths by two of Hubble’s instruments: the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS).\n\nNICMOS’s superb sensitivity, resolution, and field of view gave astronomers the unique opportunity to observe the structure of IRAS 16399-0937 in detail. They found it hosts a double nucleus — the galaxy’s core is thought to be formed of two separate cores in the process of merging. The two components, named IRAS 16399N and IRAS 16399S for the northern and southern parts respectively, sit over 11,000 light-years apart. However, they are both buried deep within the same swirl of cosmic gas and dust and are interacting, giving the galaxy its peculiar structure.\n\nThe nuclei are very different. IRAS 16399S appears to be a starburst region, where new stars are forming at an incredible rate. IRAS 16399N, however, is something known as a LINER nucleus (Low Ionization Nuclear Emission Region), which is a region whose emission mostly stems from weakly-ionized or neutral atoms of particular gases. The northern nucleus also hosts a black hole with some 100 million times the mass of the sun!\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt (geckzilla)\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

NGC 4707 lies roughly 22 million light-years from Earth.\n\nOver two centuries later, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope is able to &quot;chase down&quot; and view the same galaxy in far greater detail than Herschel could, allowing us to appreciate the intricacies and characteristics of NGC 4707 as never before. This striking image comprises observations from Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), one of a handful of high-resolution instruments currently aboard the space telescope.\n\nHerschel himself reportedly described NGC 4707 as a “small, stellar” galaxy; while it is classified as a spiral (type Sm), its overall shape, center, and spiral arms are very loose and undefined, and its central bulge is either very small or non-existent. It instead appears as a rough sprinkling of stars and bright flashes of blue on a dark canvas.\n\nThe blue smudges seen across the frame highlight regions of recent or ongoing star formation, with newborn stars glowing in bright, intense shades of cyan and turquoise.\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA"},"o_width":"1280","o_height":"868","dateupload":"1482425668","lastupdate":"1482957024","datetaken":"2016-12-19 06:00:00","datetakengranularity":"0","datetakenunknown":"0","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"31804","tags":"ngc4707","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"5b102400c4","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/31434032720_ca33145413_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/31434032720_ca33145413_t.jpg","height_t":"68","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/31434032720_ca33145413_m.jpg","height_s":"163","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/31434032720_ca33145413_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/31434032720_ca33145413.jpg","height_m":"339","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/31434032720_ca33145413_n.jpg","height_n":217,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/31434032720_ca33145413_z.jpg","height_z":"434","width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/31434032720_ca33145413_c.jpg","height_c":542,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/31434032720_ca33145413_b.jpg","height_l":"694","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/31434032720_5b102400c4_o.jpg","height_o":"868","width_o":"1280","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"31418781870","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"6635f257c7","server":"575","farm":1,"title":"Snow In the Sahara","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"In December 2016, snow fell in the Sahara for the first time since 1979.\n\nIn 1984, the charitable supergroup Band Aid sang: “There won’t be snow in Africa this Christmas time.” In fact, it does snow in Africa at high elevations. Kilimanjaro has long had a cap of snow and ice, though it has been shrinking. Skiiers travel for natural and manufactured snow in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and Algeria, as well as a few spots in South Africa and Lesotho.\n\nNonetheless, snow on the edge of the Sahara Desert is rare. On December 19, 2016, snow fell on the Algerian town of Ain Sefra, which is sometimes referred to as the “gateway to the desert.” The town of roughly 35,000 people sits between the Atlas Mountains and the northern edge of the Sahara. The last recorded snowfall in Ain Sefra occurred in February 1979.\n\nThe Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on the Landsat 7 satellite acquired this natural-color image of snow in North Africa on December 19, 2016. This scene shows an area near the border of Morocco and Algeria, south of the city of Bouarfa and southwest of Ain Sefra. Though the news has been dominated by snow in the Saharan city, a review of several years of satellite data suggests that snow is also pretty rare in this section of the Atlas range.

They reside in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy that is a satellite of our Milky Way galaxy. Intense radiation from the brilliant central stars is heating hydrogen in each of the nebulas, causing them to glow red.\n\nThe nebulas, together, are called NGC 248. They were discovered in 1834 by the astronomer Sir John Herschel. NGC 248 is about 60 light-years long and 20 light-years wide. It is among a number of glowing hydrogen nebulas in the dwarf satellite galaxy, which is located approximately 200,000 light-years away in the southern constellation Tucana.\n\nThe image is part of a study called Small Magellanic Cloud Investigation of Dust and Gas Evolution (SMIDGE). Astronomers are using Hubble to probe the Milky Way satellite to understand how dust is different in galaxies that have a far lower supply of heavy elements needed to create dust. The Small Magellanic Cloud has between a fifth and a tenth of the amount of heavy elements that the Milky Way does. Because it is so close, astronomers can study its dust in great detail, and learn about what dust was like earlier in the history of the universe. “It is important for understanding the history of our own galaxy, too,” explained the study’s principal investigator, Dr. Karin Sandstrom of the University of California, San Diego. Most of the star formation happened earlier in the universe, at a time where there was a much lower percentage of heavy elements than there is now. “Dust is a really critical part of how a galaxy works, how it forms stars,” said Sandstrom.\n\nCredit: NASA, ESA, STScI, K.

One particular member of this cosmic community, NGC 4388, is captured in this image, as seen by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3.\n\nLocated some 60 million light-years away, NGC 4388 is experiencing some of the less desirable effects that come with belonging to such a massive galaxy cluster. It is undergoing a transformation and has taken on a somewhat confused identity.\n\nWhile the galaxy’s outskirts appear smooth and featureless, a classic feature of an elliptical galaxy, its center displays remarkable dust lanes constrained within two symmetric spiral arms, which emerge from the galaxy’s glowing core — one of the obvious features of a spiral galaxy. Within the arms, speckles of bright blue mark the locations of young stars, indicating that NGC 4388 has hosted recent bursts of star formation.\n\nDespite the mixed messages, NGC 4388 is classified as a spiral galaxy. Its unusual combination of features are thought to have been caused by interactions between NGC 4388 and other galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. Gravitational interactions — from glancing blows to head-on collisions, tidal influencing, mergers, and galactic cannibalism — can be devastating to galaxies. While some may be lucky enough to simply suffer a distorted spiral arm or newly-triggered wave of star formation, others see their structure and contents completely and irrevocably altered.\n\nImage credits: ESA/NASA"},"o_width":"1280","o_height":"901","dateupload":"1481309550","lastupdate":"1481912643","datetaken":"2016-12-05 06:00:00","datetakengranularity":"0","datetakenunknown":"0","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"38128","tags":"ngc4388","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"781cb6f866","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/97/30693823084_a47a8d8c01_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/97/30693823084_a47a8d8c01_t.jpg","height_t":"70","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/97/30693823084_a47a8d8c01_m.jpg","height_s":"169","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/97/30693823084_a47a8d8c01_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/97/30693823084_a47a8d8c01.jpg","height_m":"352","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/97/30693823084_a47a8d8c01_n.jpg","height_n":225,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/97/30693823084_a47a8d8c01_z.jpg","height_z":"451","width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/97/30693823084_a47a8d8c01_c.jpg","height_c":563,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/97/30693823084_a47a8d8c01_b.jpg","height_l":"721","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/97/30693823084_781cb6f866_o.jpg","height_o":"901","width_o":"1280","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"31382679142","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"47310d721d","server":"5478","farm":6,"title":"NASA Spots an \"Eye\" of Smoke and Phytoplankton near Cape Barren Island","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite passed over Australia's Cape Barren Island and captured an image of phytoplankton and smoke from fires that resembled an eye and eyebrow.\n\nThe Tasmanian Fire Service reported that a vegetation fire near Thunder and Lightning Bay, Cape Barren Island started on December 4 and was still blazing on December 8. Cape Barren Island is one of a trail of islands in the Bass Strait of the South Pacific Ocean, between southeastern Australia and Tasmania.\n\nThis natural-color satellite image from Dec. 7 was collected by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument that flies aboard NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite.\n\nThe red dots in the image represent heat signatures from the fires as detected by VIIRS. A light grey stream of smoke was blowing to the southeast in what could be seen as the &quot;eyebrow&quot; to the &quot;eye&quot; or swirl of blue and green phytoplankton below it.\n\nPhytoplankton are tiny microscopic plant-like organisms that form the base of the marine food chain. Like land plants, phytoplankton contain chlorophyll which is used in photosynthesis to turn sunlight into chemical energy. The chlorophyll gives the phytoplankton their green color, which is visible from space when large numbers of the organism group together.\n\nNASA image courtesy MODIS Rapid Response Team #nasagoddard #earth #smoke #Phytoplankton #science\n\nb&gt;<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

These structures are common throughout the Universe, and are found within the majority of spiral, many irregular, and some lenticular galaxies. Two of our closest cosmic neighbors, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, are barred, indicating that they may have once been barred spiral galaxies that were disrupted or torn apart by the gravitational pull of the Milky Way.\n\nResearchers at the University of Leicester, England note there are two types of irregular galaxy. Type I's are usually single galaxies of peculiar appearance. They contain a large fraction of young stars, and show the luminous nebulae that are also visible in spiral galaxies. Type II irregulars include the group known as interacting or disrupting galaxies, in which the strange appearance is due to two or more galaxies colliding, merging or otherwise interacting gravitationally.\n\nSomething similar might be happening with IC 3583. This small galaxy is thought to be gravitationally interacting with one of its neighbors, the spiral Messier 90. Together, the duo form a pairing known as Arp 76. It’s still unclear whether these flirtations are the cause of IC 3583’s irregular appearance — but whatever the cause, the galaxy makes for a strikingly delicate sight in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image, glimmering in the blackness of space.\n\nImage Credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

It certainly lives up to its name — the stars that call this galaxy home are smeared out across the sky in an apparently disorderly and irregular jumble, giving NGC 4789A a far more subtle and abstract appearance than its glitzy spiral and elliptical cousins.\n\nThese stars may look as if they have been randomly sprinkled on the sky, but they are all held together by gravity. The colors in this image have been deliberately exaggerated to emphasize the mix of blue and red stars. The blue stars are bright, hot and massive stars that have formed relatively recently, whereas the red stars are much older. The presence of both tells us that stars have been forming in this galaxy throughout its history.\n\nAt a distance of just over 14 million light-years away NGC 4789A is relatively close to us, allowing us to see many of the individual stars within its bounds. This image also reveals numerous other galaxies, far more distant, that appear as fuzzy shapes spread across the image.\n\nImage Credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, Acknowledgements: Judy Schmidt (Geckzilla)\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

The moon won’t be this super again until 2034!\n\nShare your supermoon photos using #NASAsupermoon on social media."},"o_width":"1920","o_height":"1080","dateupload":"1478721062","lastupdate":"1478993627","datetaken":"2016-11-09 11:51:02","datetakengranularity":0,"datetakenunknown":"1","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"43701","tags":"supermoon super moon nasasupermoon lro","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"f5e2b58fa9","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"video","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/30247919513_9c875934e8_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/30247919513_9c875934e8_t.jpg","height_t":"56","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/30247919513_9c875934e8_m.jpg","height_s":"135","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/30247919513_9c875934e8_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/30247919513_9c875934e8.jpg","height_m":"281","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/30247919513_9c875934e8_n.jpg","height_n":180,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/30247919513_9c875934e8_z.jpg","height_z":360,"width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/30247919513_9c875934e8_c.jpg","height_c":450,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/30247919513_9c875934e8_b.jpg","height_l":"576","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/30247919513_f5e2b58fa9_o.jpg","height_o":"1080","width_o":"1920","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"30139176693","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"afa94227dc","server":"5587","farm":6,"title":"Hubble Takes Flight with the Toucan and the Cluster","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"It may be famous for hosting spectacular sights such as the Tucana Dwarf Galaxy and 47 Tucanae (heic1510), the second brightest globular cluster in the night sky, but the southern constellation of Tucana (The Toucan) also possesses a variety of unsung cosmic beauties.\n\nOne such beauty is NGC 299, an open star cluster located within the Small Magellanic Cloud just under 200,000 light-years away. Open clusters such as this are collections of stars weakly bound by the shackles of gravity, all of which formed from the same massive molecular cloud of gas and dust. Because of this, all the stars have the same age and composition, but vary in their mass because they formed at different positions within the cloud.\n\nThis unique property not only ensures a spectacular sight when viewed through a sophisticated instrument attached to a telescope such as Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys, but gives astronomers a cosmic laboratory in which to study the formation and evolution of stars — a process that is thought to depend strongly on a star’s mass.\n\nCredit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

Appropriately, combined with the rest of the observatory, the mirrors will help piece together puzzles scientists have been trying to solve throughout the cosmos.\n\nWebb's primary mirror will collect light for the observatory in the scientific quest to better understand our solar system and beyond. Using these mirrors and Webb's infrared vision scientists will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe. Unprecedented infrared sensitivity will help astronomers to compare the faintest, earliest galaxies to today's grand spirals and ellipticals, helping us to understand how galaxies assemble over billions of years. Webb will see behind cosmic dust clouds to see where stars and planetary systems are being born. It will also help reveal information about atmospheres of planets outside our solar system, and perhaps even find signs of the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe.\n\nThe Webb telescope was mounted upright after a &quot;center of curvature&quot; test conducted at Goddard. This initial center of curvature test ensures the integrity and accuracy, and test will be repeated later to verify those same properties after the structure undergoes launch environment testing. In the photo, two technicians stand before the giant primary mirror.\n\nFor information on the Webb's Center of Curvature test, visit: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2fidD9S\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2fidD9S</a>\n\nCredit: NASA/Goddard/Chris Gunn\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

Completes Webb Telescope Center of Curvature Pre-test","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"Engineers and technicians working on the James Webb Space Telescope successfully completed the first important optical measurement of Webb’s fully assembled primary mirror, called a Center of Curvature test.\n\nTaking a “before” optical measurement of the telescope’s deployed mirror is crucial before the telescope goes into several stages of rigorous mechanical testing. These tests will simulate the violent sound and vibration environments the telescope will experience inside its rocket on its way out into space. This environment is one of the most stressful structurally and could alter the shape and alignment of Webb’s primary mirror, which could degrade or, in the worst case, ruin its performance. \n\nWebb has been designed and constructed to withstand its launch environment, but it must be tested to verify that it will indeed survive and not change in any unexpected way. Making the same optical measurements both before and after simulated launch environment testing and comparing the results is fundamental to Webb’s development, assuring that it will work in space.\n\nCredit: NASA/Goddard/Chris Gunn\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2enIgwP\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2enIgwP</a>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

But this older ice is becoming weaker because there’s less of it and the remaining old ice is more broken up and thinner, so that bulwark is not as good as it used to be.”\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2dPJ9zT\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2dPJ9zT</a>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

These ornate spheres contain hundreds of thousands of stars, and reside in the outskirts of galaxies. The Milky Way contains over 150 such clusters — and the one shown in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image, named NGC 362, is one of the more unusual ones.\n\nAs stars make their way through life they fuse elements together in their cores, creating heavier and heavier elements — known in astronomy as metals — in the process. When these stars die, they flood their surroundings with the material they have formed during their lifetimes, enriching the interstellar medium with metals. Stars that form later therefore contain higher proportions of metals than their older relatives.\n\nBy studying the different elements present within individual stars in NGC 362, astronomers discovered that the cluster boasts a surprisingly high metal content, indicating that it is younger than expected. Although most globular clusters are much older than the majority of stars in their host galaxy, NGC 362 bucks the trend, with an age lying between 10 and 11 billion years old. For reference, the age of the Milky Way is estimated to be above 13 billion years.\n\nThis image, in which you can view NGC 362’s individual stars, was taken by Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS).\n\nCredit: ESA/Hubble&amp; NASA\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

Material courses through not only the star itself, but throughout its expansive atmosphere. Understanding the dance of this charged gas is a key part of better understanding our sun – how it heats up its atmosphere, how it creates a steady flow of solar wind streaming outward in all directions, and how magnetic fields twist and turn to create regions that can explode in giant eruptions. Now, for the first time, researchers have tracked a particular kind of solar wave as it swept upward from the sun's surface through its atmosphere, adding to our understanding of how solar material travels throughout the sun. \n\nScientists analyzed sunspot images from a trio of observatories -- including the Big Bear Solar Observatory, which captured this footage -- to make the first-ever observations of a solar wave traveling up into the sun’s atmosphere from a sunspot.\n\nTracking solar waves like this provides a novel tool for scientists to study the atmosphere of the sun. The imagery of the journey also confirms existing ideas, helping to nail down the existence of a mechanism that moves energy – and therefore heat – into the sun’s mysteriously-hot upper atmosphere, called the corona. A study on these results was published Oct. 11, 2016, in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nImage credit: Zhao et al/NASA/SDO/IRIS/BBSO\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2dRv80g\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2dRv80g</a>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

The escape rate peaked when Mars was at its closest point to the sun and dropped off when the planet was farthest from the sun. The rate of loss varied dramatically overall, with 10 times more hydrogen escaping at the maximum.\n\n“MAVEN is giving us unprecedented detail about hydrogen escape from the upper atmosphere of Mars, and this is crucial for helping us figure out the total amount of water lost over billions of years,” said Ali Rahmati, a MAVEN team member at the University of California at Berkeley who analyzed data from two of the spacecraft’s instruments.\n\nHydrogen in Mars’ upper atmosphere comes from water vapor in the lower atmosphere. An atmospheric water molecule can be broken apart by sunlight, releasing the two hydrogen atoms from the oxygen atom that they had been bound to. Several processes at work in Mars’ upper atmosphere may then act on the hydrogen, leading to its escape.\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2dAgAV4\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2dAgAV4</a>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

NGC 247 is a relatively small spiral galaxy in the southern constellation of Cetus (The Whale). Lying at a distance of around 11 million light-years from us, it forms part of the Sculptor Group, a loose collection of galaxies that also contains the more famous NGC 253 (otherwise known as the Sculptor Galaxy).\n\nNGC 247’s nucleus is visible here as a bright, whitish patch, surrounded by a mixture of stars, gas and dust. The dust forms dark patches and filaments that are silhouetted against the background of stars, while the gas has formed into bright knots known as H II regions, mostly scattered throughout the galaxy’s arms and outer areas.\n\nThis galaxy displays one particularly unusual and mysterious feature — it is not visible in this image, but can be seen clearly in wider views of the galaxy, such as a picture from ESO’s MPG/ESO 2.2-meter telescope. The northern part of NGC 247’s disc hosts an apparent void, a gap in the usual swarm of stars and H II regions that spans almost a third of the galaxy’s total length.\n\nThere are stars within this void, but they are quite different from those around it. They are significantly older, and as a result much fainter and redder. This indicates that the star formation taking place across most of the galaxy’s disk has somehow been arrested in the void region, and has not taken place for around one billion years. Although astronomers are still unsure how the void formed, recent studies suggest it might have been caused by gravitational interactions with part of another galaxy.\n\nImage Credit: NASA/ESA"},"o_width":"1280","o_height":"1186","dateupload":"1475858788","lastupdate":"1475878138","datetaken":"2016-10-03 06:00:00","datetakengranularity":"0","datetakenunknown":"0","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"32856","tags":"ngc247","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"5d20c5039b","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/30139116046_56397d6cbf_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/30139116046_56397d6cbf_t.jpg","height_t":"93","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/30139116046_56397d6cbf_m.jpg","height_s":"222","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/30139116046_56397d6cbf_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/30139116046_56397d6cbf.jpg","height_m":"463","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/30139116046_56397d6cbf_n.jpg","height_n":297,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/30139116046_56397d6cbf_z.jpg","height_z":"593","width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/30139116046_56397d6cbf_c.jpg","height_c":741,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/30139116046_56397d6cbf_b.jpg","height_l":"949","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/30139116046_5d20c5039b_o.jpg","height_o":"1186","width_o":"1280","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"30084909991","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"e9ba62aa65","server":"8418","farm":9,"title":"NASA's 3D view shows Hurricane Matthew's intensity","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"Scientists use satellite data to peer into the massive storm – learning how and why it changed throughout its course.\n\nMore info: <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/matthew\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasa.gov/matthew</a>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

Just hours after landfall, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite acquired this natural-color image. At the time, Matthew had top sustained winds of about 230 kilometers (145 miles) per hour.\n\nEarlier on October 4, temperature data collected by MODIS on NASA’s Aqua satellite revealed that the cloud tops around Matthew were very cold (at least -57° Celsius, or -70° Fahrenheit). Cold cloud tops are known to produce heavy rainfall. The National Hurricane Center called for 380 to 500 millimeters (15 to 20 inches) of rain in Southern Haiti and in the southwestern Dominican Republic.\n\nThe northward movement of the storm should bring the center of Matthew over eastern Cuba late on October 4. Dangerous conditions can extend far beyond a storm’s center. According to National Hurricane Center forecasters, Matthew is “likely to produce devastating impacts from storm surge, extreme winds, heavy rains, flash floods, and/or mudslides in portions of the watch and warning areas in Haiti, Cuba, and the Bahamas.”\n\nNASA Earth Observatory image by Joshua Stevens, using MODIS data from the Land Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE).

The ultraviolet colors of the planet have been rendered in false color, to show what we would see with ultraviolet-sensitive eyes. The ultraviolet (UV) view gives several new perspectives on Mars. Valles Marineris, a two-thousand-mile canyon system, appears prominently across the middle of the image as a blue gash. The deep canyon appears blue due to the scattering of ultraviolet light by the atmosphere, so strong that we cannot make out the bottom of the canyon. The greenish cast of the planet as a whole is a combination of the reflection of the surface plus the atmospheric scattering. The three tall Tharsis volcanoes appear near the left edge, dotted by white clouds forming as the winds flow over them. Bright white polar caps appear at both poles, typical for this season, in which there is a transition from southern-hemisphere winter to summer. The magenta-colored region visible at the south pole shows where ozone is absorbing ultraviolet light — the same property of ozone that protects life on Earth from harmful UV radiation. While ozone tends to be destroyed by chemical processes in the winter on Earth, different atmospheric chemistry at Mars caused it to build up in the winter there. A hint of ozone is also visible near the north pole; more will accumulate there as winter is coming. IUVS obtains images of Mars every orbit when the sunlit portion of the planet is visible from high altitude.\n\nCredits: NASA/Goddard/University of Colorado/LASP\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2d9aU1N\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2d9aU1N</a>\n\nToday, NASA’s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission completed one Mars year of science observations. One Mars year is just under two Earth years.\n\nMAVEN launched on Nov. 18, 2013, and went into orbit around Mars on Sept. 21, 2014. During its time at Mars, MAVEN has answered many questions about the Red Planet.\n\n“Taken together, the MAVEN results tell us that loss of gas from the atmosphere to space has been the major force behind the climate having changed from a warm, wet environment to the cold, dry one that we see today,” said Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN principal investigator, from the University of Colorado in Boulder.\n\nNASA recently declared that MAVEN had achieved mission success during its primary mission.  Mission success means that the spacecraft operated as intended, made the expected science measurements, and achieved its proposed science objectives.\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

Named NGC 24, the galaxy was discovered by British astronomer William Herschel in 1785, and measures some 40,000 light-years across.\n\nThis picture was taken using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope’s Advanced Camera for Surveys, known as ACS for short. It shows NGC 24 in detail, highlighting the blue bursts (young stars), dark lanes (cosmic dust), and red bubbles (hydrogen gas) of material peppered throughout the galaxy’s spiral arms. Numerous distant galaxies can also been seen hovering around NGC 24’s perimeter.\n\nHowever, there may be more to this picture than first meets the eye. Astronomers suspect that spiral galaxies like NGC 24 and the Milky Way are surrounded by, and contained within, extended haloes of dark matter. Dark matter is a mysterious substance that cannot be seen; instead, it reveals itself via its gravitational interactions with surrounding material. Its existence was originally proposed to explain why the outer parts of galaxies, including our own, rotate unexpectedly fast, but it is thought to also play an essential role in a galaxy’s formation and evolution. Most of NGC 24’s mass — a whopping 80 percent — is thought to be held within such a dark halo.\n\nImage Credit: NASA/ESA\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

The star is ending its life by casting off its outer layers of gas, which formed a cocoon around the star's remaining core. Ultraviolet light from the dying star makes the material glow. The burned-out star, called a white dwarf, is the white dot in the center. Our sun will eventually burn out and shroud itself with stellar debris, but not for another 5 billion years.\n\nOur Milky Way Galaxy is littered with these stellar relics, called planetary nebulae. The objects have nothing to do with planets. Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century astronomers called them the name because through small telescopes they resembled the disks of the distant planets Uranus and Neptune. The planetary nebula in this image is called NGC 2440. The white dwarf at the center of NGC 2440 is one of the hottest known, with a surface temperature of more than 360,000 degrees Fahrenheit (200,000 degrees Celsius). The nebula's chaotic structure suggests that the star shed its mass episodically. During each outburst, the star expelled material in a different direction. This can be seen in the two bowtie-shaped lobes. The nebula also is rich in clouds of dust, some of which form long, dark streaks pointing away from the star. NGC 2440 lies about 4,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Puppis.\n\nThe material expelled by the star glows with different colors depending on its composition, its density and how close it is to the hot central star.

It completes an orbit around both stars roughly every seven years. The two red dwarf stars are a mere 7 million miles apart, or 14 times the diameter of the moon's orbit around Earth.\n\nThe Hubble observations represent the first time such a three-body system has been confirmed using the gravitational microlensing technique. Gravitational microlensing occurs when the gravity of a foreground star bends and amplifies the light of a background star that momentarily aligns with it. The particular character of the light magnification can reveal clues to the nature of the foreground star and any associated planets.\n\nThe three objects were discovered in 2007 by an international collaboration of five different groups: Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA), the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), the Microlensing Follow-up Network (MicroFUN), the Probing Lensing Anomalies Network (PLANET), and the Robonet Collaboration. These ground-based observations uncovered a star and a planet, but a detailed analysis also revealed a third body that astronomers could not definitively identify.\n\nImage caption: This artist's illustration shows a gas giant planet circling a pair of red dwarf stars in the system OGLE-2007-BLG-349, located 8,000 light-years away.

The NASA-funded BARREL – which stands for Balloon Array for Radiation-belt Relativistic Electron Losses – primarily measures X-rays in Earth’s atmosphere near the North and South Poles. These X-rays are produced by electrons raining down into the atmosphere from two giant swaths of radiation that surround Earth, called the Van Allen belts. Learning about the radiation near Earth helps us to better protect our satellites. \n\nSeveral of the BARREL balloons also carried instruments built by undergraduate students to measure the total electron content of Earth’s ionosphere, as well as the low-frequency electromagnetic waves that help to scatter electrons into Earth’s atmosphere. Though about 90 feet in diameter, the BARREL balloons are much smaller than standard football stadium-sized scientific balloons.\n\nThis is the fourth campaign for the BARREL mission.

The bears have evolved mainly to eat seals, which provide necessary fats and nutrients in the harsh Arctic environment. Polar bears can't outswim their prey, so instead they perch on the ice as a platform and ambush seals at breathing holes or break through the ice to access their dens.\nThe total number of ice-covered days declined at the rate of seven to 19 days per decade between 1979 and 2014. The decline was even greater in the Barents Sea and the Arctic basin. Sea ice concentration during the summer months — an important measure because summertime is when some subpopulations are forced to fast on land — also declined in all regions, by 1 percent to 9 percent per decade.\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2cIZSSc\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2cIZSSc</a>\n\nPhoto credit: Mario Hoppmann"},"o_width":"2048","o_height":"1365","dateupload":"1473955168","lastupdate":"1483454578","datetaken":"2016-09-15 11:59:28","datetakengranularity":0,"datetakenunknown":"1","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"31976","tags":"","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"a16700399f","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/29664357826_d7d436f112_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/29664357826_d7d436f112_t.jpg","height_t":"67","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/29664357826_d7d436f112_m.jpg","height_s":"160","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/29664357826_d7d436f112_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/29664357826_d7d436f112.jpg","height_m":"333","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/29664357826_d7d436f112_n.jpg","height_n":213,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/29664357826_d7d436f112_z.jpg","height_z":"427","width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/29664357826_d7d436f112_c.jpg","height_c":534,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/29664357826_d7d436f112_b.jpg","height_l":"683","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/29664357826_a16700399f_o.jpg","height_o":"1365","width_o":"2048","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"29571280212","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"c1b8b8c17b","server":"7772","farm":8,"title":"Asteroid Redirect Mission Update","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"Dr. Holdren (left), Administrator Bolden (center) and Dr. Michele Gates (right) discuss the ARM mission during a live NASA TV briefing.

Located in the constellation of Centaurus (The Centaur), at a distance of 4.3 light-years, this system is made up of the binary formed by the stars Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, plus the faint red dwarf Alpha Centauri C, also known as Proxima Centauri.\n\nThis NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has given us this stunning view of the bright Alpha Centauri A (on the left) and Alpha Centauri B (on the right), shining like huge cosmic headlamps in the dark. The image was captured by the Wide-Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). WFPC2 was Hubble’s most used instrument for the first 13 years of the space telescope’s life, being replaced in 2009 by Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) during Servicing Mission 4. This portrait of Alpha Centauri was produced by observations carried out at optical and near-infrared wavelengths.\n\nCompared to the sun, Alpha Centauri A is of the same stellar type, G2, and slightly bigger, while Alpha Centauri B, a K1-type star, is slightly smaller. They orbit a common center of gravity once every 80 years, with a minimum distance of about 11 times the distance between Earth and the sun. Because these two stars are, together with their sibling Proxima Centauri, the closest to Earth, they are among the best studied by astronomers. And they are also among the prime targets in the hunt for habitable exoplanets.\n\nUsing the European Space Organization's HARPS instrument, astronomers already discovered a planet orbiting Alpha Centauri B.  Then on Aug. 24, 2016, astronomers announced the intriguing discovery of a nearly Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone orbiting the star Proxima Centauri\n\nImage credit: ESA/NASA\n"},"o_width":"1280","o_height":"836","dateupload":"1472831035","lastupdate":"1473525455","datetaken":"2016-05-19 11:46:24","datetakengranularity":0,"datetakenunknown":"1","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"36127","tags":"alphacentauri","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"93a97586d7","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/29327410501_75b7fe0a3e_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/29327410501_75b7fe0a3e_t.jpg","height_t":"65","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/29327410501_75b7fe0a3e_m.jpg","height_s":"157","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/29327410501_75b7fe0a3e_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/29327410501_75b7fe0a3e.jpg","height_m":"327","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/29327410501_75b7fe0a3e_n.jpg","height_n":209,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/29327410501_75b7fe0a3e_z.jpg","height_z":"418","width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/29327410501_75b7fe0a3e_c.jpg","height_c":523,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/29327410501_75b7fe0a3e_b.jpg","height_l":"669","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/29327410501_93a97586d7_o.jpg","height_o":"836","width_o":"1280","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"28697536924","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"026cff1667","server":"8333","farm":9,"title":"Astronomers puzzle over a peculiar age-defying massive star","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"An age-defying star designated as IRAS 19312+1950 exhibits features characteristic of a very young star and a very old star.

But the presence of a nearby interstellar bubble, which indicates the presence of a recently formed massive star, also supports this idea.\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2bMza9d\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2bMza9d</a>\n\nImage Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n"},"o_width":"1041","o_height":"586","dateupload":"1472494861","lastupdate":"1472919983","datetaken":"2016-08-23 13:44:56","datetakengranularity":0,"datetakenunknown":"1","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"40389","tags":"","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"d1dec6c701","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/28697536924_026cff1667_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/28697536924_026cff1667_t.jpg","height_t":"56","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/28697536924_026cff1667_m.jpg","height_s":"135","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/28697536924_026cff1667_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/28697536924_026cff1667.jpg","height_m":"281","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/28697536924_026cff1667_n.jpg","height_n":180,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/28697536924_026cff1667_z.jpg","height_z":"360","width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/28697536924_026cff1667_c.jpg","height_c":450,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/28697536924_026cff1667_b.jpg","height_l":"576","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/28697536924_d1dec6c701_o.jpg","height_o":"586","width_o":"1041","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"28692371354","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"076758472d","server":"8893","farm":9,"title":"NASA's BARREL Mission in Sweden","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"The BARREL team inflates the balloon to launch their fifth scientific payload from Esrange Space Center near Kiruna, Sweden, on Aug. 24, 2016. \n\nThe BARREL team is at Esrange Space Center launching a series of six scientific payloads on miniature scientific balloons.

They are usually found orbiting other larger galaxies such as our own, and are thought to form from the material left over from the messy formation of their larger cosmic relatives.\n\nNGC 5264 clearly possesses an irregular shape — unlike the more common spiral or elliptical galaxies — with knots of blue star formation. Astronomers believe that this is due to the gravitational interactions between NGC 5264 and other galaxies nearby. These past flirtations sparked the formation of new generations of stars, which now glow in bright shades of blue.\n\nCredit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

During the Pleistocene Ice Age, glaciers sculpted the underlying rocks in this region, leaving behind canyons, waterfalls, rugged peaks, and granite domes. As the ice retreated, forests grew, but forests only extend as high as 2,900 meters (9,500 feet) above sea level. Above the tree line are rocky landscapes with sparse alpine vegetation. So from the sky, Yosemite Valley appears as a light-and-dark patchwork of forest, rock, and shadow.\n\nThe Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus on NASA’s Landsat 7 satellite captured this true-color image of part of Yosemite Valley on August 18, 2001. The valley runs roughly east-west, and tall granite peaks lining the valley’s southern side cast long shadows across the valley floor. On the valley’s northern side, steep slopes appear almost white. Along the valley floor, roadways form narrow, meandering lines of off-white, past parking lots, buildings, and meadows.\n\nOn the north side of Yosemite Valley is El Capitan. Shooting straight up more than 915 meters (3,000 feet) above the valley floor, El Capitan is considered the largest granite monolith in the world. This granite monolith sits across the valley from Bridalveil Fall, one of the valley’s most prominent waterfalls.\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2bzGo3d\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2bzGo3d</a>\n\nCredit: NASA/Landsat7\n\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

The 169-kilometer (105-mile) Skyline Drive that meanders across the crest of the ridge is often jammed with tourists in autumn.\n\nThe park includes more than 518 miles of hiking trails, including more than 100 miles of the Appalachian Trail. The highest peak is Hawksbill Mountain at 4,051 feet (1,235 m), but the most popular with hikers is Old Rag Mountain. A circuitous eight-mile (13 kilometer) trail leads to an exposed, rocky summit 3,291 feet (1,003 meters) above sea level. The 2,200 foot elevation change from base to summit, combined with several rock scrambles, make Old Rag not only the most popular but also the most dangerous hike.\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2bRnFxH\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2bRnFxH</a>\n\nCredit: NASA/Landsat5\n\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

If you walked from west to east across Olympic National Park, you would start at the rocky Pacific shoreline, move into rare temperate rainforests and lush river valleys, ascend glaciers and rugged mountain peaks, and then descend into a comparatively dry rain shadow and alpine forest. From the beach to the top of Mount Olympus, you would rise 7,980 feet (2430 meters) above sea level.\n\nSituated on the Olympic Peninsula in northwestern Washington, these lands were first set aside as a national monument in 1909 by Theodore Roosevelt. Twenty-nine years later, his cousin Franklin officially established Olympic National Park. International institutions have also made a case for treasuring this land, as the area was declared an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976 and a World Heritage Site in 1981. The park encompasses nearly 923,000 acres of wild lands, including 60 named glaciers, 73 miles of coast, and 3,000 miles of rivers and streams.\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2bRmzSJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2bRmzSJ</a>\n\nCredit: NASA/Landsat8\n\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

Along the coast, sandy beaches appear off-white, and sediments form swirls of pale blue in the darker blue sea. Inland, the park is dominated by green vegetation, with isolated patches of gray-beige rock.\n\nThis image of the Redwood National Park includes two stands of trees: Lady Bird Johnson Grove and Tall Trees Grove. The first grove was dedicated to the former first lady by President Richard Nixon in August 1969. The second grove became the focus of efforts to protect the surrounding area from logging. Two waterways appear in this image: Redwood Creek and Klamath River. The more conspicuous Klamath River flows through the park system’s midsection (north of the area pictured here). Redwood Creek flows through the southern portion of the park system. Both waterways have carved gorges through the mountainous landscape.\n\nRedwood National and State Parks occupy an area considered to be the most seismically active in the United States. The frequent seismic activity has led to shifting waterways, landslides, and rapid erosion along the coastline.\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2bRlryv\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2bRlryv</a>\n\nCredit: NASA/Landsat7\n\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

The park is celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2016. On September 6, 2015, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on the Landsat 8 satellite acquired these images of Acadia National Park and its surroundings.\n\nMountains and hills roll right up to the Atlantic Ocean in this rocky landscape carved by glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age. Since the beginning of the 20th Century, the park has been pieced together by donations and acquisitions of once-private lands, and it is still growing. Of the park’s 47,000 acres, more than 12,000 are privately owned lands under conservation agreements, while the rest is held by the National Park Service. Mount Desert Island is the focal point of the park, which also includes lands around a former naval base (Schoodic Peninsula), Isle au Haut, and several smaller islands.\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/2adyd8J\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/2adyd8J</a>\n\nCredit: NASA/Landsat8\n\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

The aftermath of this energetic detonation is shown here in this striking image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3.\n\nThe exploding star was a white dwarf located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of our nearest neighboring galaxies. Around 97 percent of stars within the Milky Way that are between a tenth and eight times the mass of the sun are expected to end up as white dwarfs. These stars can face a number of different fates, one of which is to explode as supernovae, some of the brightest events ever observed in the universe. If a white dwarf is part of a binary star system, it can siphon material from a close companion. After gobbling up more than it can handle — and swelling to approximately one and a half times the size of the sun — the star becomes unstable and ignites as a Type Ia supernova.\n\nThis was the case for the supernova remnant pictured here, which is known as DEM L71. It formed when a white dwarf reached the end of its life and ripped itself apart, ejecting a superheated cloud of debris in the process. Slamming into the surrounding interstellar gas, this stellar shrapnel gradually diffused into the separate fiery filaments of material seen scattered across this skyscape.\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, Y.

NGC 2337 is an irregular galaxy, meaning that it — along with a quarter of all galaxies in the Universe — lacks a distinct, regular appearance. The galaxy  was discovered in 1877 by the French astronomer Édouard Stephan who, in the same year, discovered the galactic group Stephan’s Quintet (heic0910i). \n\nAlthough irregular galaxies may never win a beauty prize when competing with their more symmetrical spiral and elliptical peers, astronomers consider them to be very important. Some irregular galaxies may have once fallen into one of the regular classes of the Hubble sequence, but were warped and deformed by a passing cosmic companion. As such, irregular galaxies provide astronomers with a valuable opportunity to learn more about galactic evolution and interaction.\n\nDespite the disruption, gravitational interactions between galaxies can kickstart star formation activity within the affected galaxies, which may explain the pockets of blue light scattered throughout NGC 2337. These patches and knots of blue signal the presence of young, newly formed, hot stars.\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA\nText credit: European Space Agency\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

Knowing whether Greenland’s ice lies on wet, slippery ground or is anchored to dry, frozen bedrock is essential for predicting how this ice will flow in the future, But scientists have very few direct observations of the thermal conditions beneath the ice sheet, obtained through fewer than two dozen boreholes that have reached the bottom.

These rippling wisps of ionized gas, named DEM L316A, are located some 160,000 light-years away within one of the Milky Way’s closest galactic neighbors — the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\n\nThe explosion that formed DEM L316A was an example of an especially energetic and bright variety of supernova, known as a Type Ia. Such supernova events are thought to occur when a white dwarf star steals more material than it can handle from a nearby companion, and becomes unbalanced. The result is a spectacular release of energy in the form of a bright, violent explosion, which ejects the star’s outer layers into the surrounding space at immense speeds. As this expelled gas travels through the interstellar material, it heats up and ionizes it, producing the faint glow that Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 has captured here.\n\nThe LMC orbits the Milky Way as a satellite galaxy and is the fourth largest in our group of galaxies, the Local Group. DEM L316A is not the only supernova remnant in the LMC; Hubble came across another one in 2010 with SNR 0509, and in 2013 it snapped SNR 0519.\n\nImage credit: ESA (European Space Agency)/Hubble &amp; NASA, Y.

Spanning 15,000 light-years, the galaxy displays massive and violent bursts of star formation, as shown by the hot, young, and blue stars scattered throughout the galaxy’s rose-tinted core. Some of these clumps of stars are notable — one of the most extreme Wolf–Rayet star clusters in the local Universe, NGC 3125-A1, resides within NGC 3125.\n\nDespite their appearance, the fuzzy white blobs dotted around the edge of this galaxy are not stars, but globular clusters. Found within a galaxy’s halo, globular clusters are ancient collections of hundreds of thousands of stars. They orbit around galactic centers like satellites — the Milky Way, for example, hosts over 150 of them.\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

This galaxy lies some 300 million light-years away from us, and is currently experiencing an extraordinarily high rate of star formation — a starburst. \n\nNormal galaxies produce only a couple of new stars per year, but starburst galaxies can produce a hundred times more than that. As MCG+07-33-027 is seen face-on, the galaxy’s spiral arms and the bright star-forming regions within them are clearly visible and easy for astronomers to study.\n\nIn order to form newborn stars, the parent galaxy has to hold a large reservoir of gas, which is slowly depleted to spawn stars over time. For galaxies in a state of starburst, this intense period of star formation has to be triggered somehow — often this happens due to a collision with another galaxy. MCG+07-33-027, however, is special; while many galaxies are located within a large cluster of galaxies, MCG+07-33-027 is a field galaxy, which means it is rather isolated. Thus, the triggering of the starburst was most likely not due to a collision with a neighboring or passing galaxy and astronomers are still speculating about the cause. The bright object to the right of the galaxy is a foreground star in our own galaxy.\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA and N.

As the humid air rises to a higher altitude, the moisture condenses into droplets, forming clouds. Gravity rolls these newly formed clouds into a wave-like shape. When moist air goes up, it cools, and then gravity pushes it down again. As it plummets toward the earth, the moist air is pushed up again by the dry air. Repeated again and again, this process creates gravity waves. Clouds occur at the upward wave motions, while they evaporate at the downward motions.\n\nSuch waves will often propagate in the morning and early afternoon, said Van Diedenhoven. During the course of the day, the clouds move out to sea and stretch out, as the dry air flowing off the land pushes the moist ocean air westward.\n\nNASA Earth Observatory image by Jesse Allen, using data from the Land Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE).\n\nvia @NASAEarth <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/29Btxcy\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/29Btxcy</a>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/29BtHR6\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/29BtDku\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

The inner region sends out clock-like pulses of radiation and tsunamis of charged particles embedded in magnetic fields.\n\nThe neutron star at the very center of the Crab Nebula has about the same mass as the sun but compressed into an incredibly dense sphere that is only a few miles across. Spinning 30 times a second, the neutron star shoots out detectable beams of energy that make it look like it's pulsating.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope snapshot is centered on the region around the neutron star (the rightmost of the two bright stars near the center of this image) and the expanding, tattered, filamentary debris surrounding it. Hubble's sharp view captures the intricate details of glowing gas, shown in red, that forms a swirling medley of cavities and filaments. Inside this shell is a ghostly blue glow that is radiation given off by electrons spiraling at nearly the speed of light in the powerful magnetic field around the crushed stellar core.\n\nThe neutron star is a showcase for extreme physical processes and unimaginable cosmic violence. Bright wisps are moving outward from the neutron star at half the speed of light to form an expanding ring. It is thought that these wisps originate from a shock wave that turns the high-speed wind from the neutron star into extremely energetic particles.\n\nWhen this &quot;heartbeat&quot; radiation signature was first discovered in 1968, astronomers realized they had discovered a new type of astronomical object. Now astronomers know it's the archetype of a class of supernova remnants called pulsars - or rapidly spinning neutron stars. These interstellar &quot;lighthouse beacons&quot; are invaluable for doing observational experiments on a variety of astronomical phenomena, including measuring gravity waves.\n\nObservations of the Crab supernova were recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054 A.D. The nebula, bright enough to be visible in amateur telescopes, is located 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus.\n\nCredits: NASA and ESA, Acknowledgment: J. Hester (ASU) and M.

The students used an online platform called Glogster to make posters about their ideas, and the general public voted for their favorites.\n\nSophia Sheehan won the elementary school prize for her invention of the “blow coat,” which would be powered by solar panels and blow warm air into winter coats, helping people in her hometown of Chicago stay warm in the winter. Heidi Long, Aubrey Nesti, Katherine Valbuena and Jasmine Wu won in the middle school category for their idea called Tent-cordion, which would use spacesuit and satellite insulation materials in a foldable tent to house refugees and the homeless. Finally, Jake Laddis, Alex Li, Isaac Wecht and Isabel Wecht won in the high school category for their idea to use James Webb Space Telescope sunshield technology to shield houses from summer heat and reduce the need for air conditioning around the world. The high school winners also had the opportunity to compete in the NASA InWorld challenge, sponsored by the James Webb Space Telescope project, and continued developing their idea in a virtual world and gaming environment.\n\nDuring their three-day workshop at Goddard, the students toured the center, met with scientists and engineers, took a look at the James Webb Space Telescope in Goddard’s clean room, and even made their own videos in Goddard’s TV studio. One of the students talked about how the experience inspired her.

NGC 1569 is a starburst galaxy, meaning that — as the name suggests — it is bursting at the seams with stars, and is currently producing them at a rate far higher than that observed in most other galaxies. For almost 100 million years, NGC 1569 has pumped out stars more than 100 times faster than the Milky Way!\n\nAs a result, this glittering galaxy is home to super star clusters, three of which are visible in this image — one of the two bright clusters is actually the superposition of two massive clusters. Each containing more than a million stars, these brilliant blue clusters reside within a large cavity of gas carved out by multiple supernovae, the energetic remnants of massive stars.\n\nIn 2008, Hubble observed the galaxy's cluttered core and sparsely populated outer fringes. By pinpointing individual red giant stars, Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys enabled astronomers to calculate a new — and much more precise — estimate for NGC 1569’s distance. This revealed that the galaxy is actually one and a half times farther away than previously thought, and a member of the IC 342 galaxy group.\n\nAstronomers suspect that the IC 342 cosmic congregation is responsible for the star-forming frenzy observed in NGC 1569. Gravitational interactions between this galactic group are believed to be compressing the gas within NGC 1569. As it is compressed, the gas collapses, heats up and forms new stars.\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, Aloisi, Ford; Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt "},"o_width":"1280","o_height":"1198","dateupload":"1467378567","lastupdate":"1468458735","datetaken":"2016-06-27 06:00:00","datetakengranularity":"0","datetakenunknown":"0","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"35591","tags":"ngc1569","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"e4b085480f","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/27403698983_52fb2c2432_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/27403698983_52fb2c2432_t.jpg","height_t":"94","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/27403698983_52fb2c2432_m.jpg","height_s":"225","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/27403698983_52fb2c2432_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/27403698983_52fb2c2432.jpg","height_m":"468","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/27403698983_52fb2c2432_n.jpg","height_n":299,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/27403698983_52fb2c2432_z.jpg","height_z":"599","width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/27403698983_52fb2c2432_c.jpg","height_c":748,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/27403698983_52fb2c2432_b.jpg","height_l":"958","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/27403698983_e4b085480f_o.jpg","height_o":"1198","width_o":"1280","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"28000029525","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"9a07cdb35a","server":"7412","farm":8,"title":"Hubble Captures Vivid Auroras in Jupiter’s Atmosphere","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"Astronomers are using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to study auroras — stunning light shows in a planet’s atmosphere — on the poles of the largest planet in the solar system, Jupiter. This observation program is supported by measurements made by NASA’s Juno spacecraft, currently on its way to Jupiter.\n\nJupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, is best known for its colorful storms, the most famous being the Great Red Spot. Now astronomers have focused on another beautiful feature of the planet, using Hubble's ultraviolet capabilities.\n\nThe extraordinary vivid glows shown in the new observations are known as auroras. They are created when high-energy particles enter a planet’s atmosphere near its magnetic poles and collide with atoms of gas. As well as producing beautiful images, this program aims to determine how various components of Jupiter’s auroras respond to different conditions in the solar wind, a stream of charged particles ejected from the sun.\n\nThis observation program is perfectly timed as NASA’s Juno spacecraft is currently in the solar wind near Jupiter and will enter the orbit of the planet in early July 2016. While Hubble is observing and measuring the auroras on Jupiter, Juno is measuring the properties of the solar wind itself; a perfect collaboration between a telescope and a space probe.\n\n“These auroras are very dramatic and among the most active I have ever seen”, said Jonathan Nichols from the University of Leicester, U.K., and principal investigator of the study. “It almost seems as if Jupiter is throwing a firework party for the imminent arrival of Juno.” Read more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/294QswK\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/294QswK</a>\n\nCredits: NASA, ESA, and J.

NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has captured a spectacular fireworks display in a small, nearby galaxy, which resembles a July 4th skyrocket.\n\nA firestorm of star birth is lighting up one end of the diminutive galaxy Kiso 5639. The dwarf galaxy is shaped like a flattened pancake, but because it is tilted edge-on, it resembles a skyrocket, with a brilliant blazing head and a long, star-studded tail.\n\nKiso 5639 is a rare, nearby example of elongated galaxies that occur in abundance at larger distances, where we observe the universe during earlier epochs. Astronomers suggest that the frenzied star birth is sparked by intergalactic gas raining on one end of the galaxy as it drifts through space.\n\n“I think Kiso 5639 is a beautiful, up-close example of what must have been common long ago,” said lead researcher Debra Elmegreen of Vassar College, in Poughkeepsie, New York. “The current thinking is that galaxies in the early universe grow from accreting gas from the surrounding neighborhood. It’s a stage that galaxies, including our Milky Way, must go through as they are growing up.”\n\nObservations of the early universe, such as Hubble’s Ultra-Deep Field, reveal that about 10 percent of all galaxies have these elongated shapes, and are collectively called “tadpoles.” But studies of the nearby universe have turned up only a few of these unusual galaxies, including Kiso 5639. The development of the nearby star-making tadpole galaxies, however, has lagged behind that of their peers, which have spent billions of years building themselves up into many of the spiral galaxies seen today.\n\nElmegreen used Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 to conduct a detailed imaging study of Kiso 5639. The images in different filters reveal information about an object by dissecting its light into its component colors. Hubble’s crisp resolution helped Elmegreen and her team analyze the giant star-forming clumps in Kiso 5639 and determine the masses and ages of the star clusters.\n\nThe international team of researchers selected Kiso 5639 from a spectroscopic survey of 10 nearby tadpole galaxies, observed with the Grand Canary Telescope in La Palma, Spain, by Jorge Sanchez Almeida and collaborators at the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias. The observations revealed that in most of those galaxies, including Kiso 5639, the gas composition is not uniform.\n\nThe bright gas in the galaxy’s head contains fewer heavier elements (collectively called “metals”), such as carbon and oxygen, than the rest of the galaxy. Stars consist mainly of hydrogen and helium, but cook up other “heavier” elements. When the stars die, they release their heavy elements and enrich the surrounding gas.\n\n“The metallicity suggests that there has to be rather pure gas, composed mostly of hydrogen, coming into the star-forming part of the galaxy, because intergalactic space contains more pristine hydrogen-rich gas,” Elmegreen explained. “Otherwise, the starburst region should be as rich in heavy elements as the rest of the galaxy.”\n\nHubble offers a detailed view of the galaxy’s star-making frenzy. The telescope uncovered several dozen clusters of stars in the galaxy’s star-forming head, which spans 2,700 light-years across. These clusters have an average age of less than 1 million years and masses that are three to six times larger than those in the rest of the galaxy. Other star formation is taking place throughout the galaxy but on a much smaller scale. Star clusters in the rest of the galaxy are between several million to a few billion years old.\n\n“There is much more star formation going on in the head than what you would expect in such a tiny galaxy,” said team member Bruce Elmegreen of IBM’s Thomas J. Watson’s Research Center, in Yorktown Heights, New York. “And we think the star formation is triggered by the ongoing accretion of metal-poor gas onto a part of an otherwise quiescent dwarf galaxy.”\n\nHubble also revealed giant holes peppered throughout the galaxy’s starburst head. These cavities give the galaxy’s head a Swiss-cheese appearance because numerous supernova detonations – like firework aerial bursts – have carved out holes of rarified superheated gas.\n\nThe galaxy, located 82 million light-years away, has taken billions of years to develop because it has been drifting through an isolated “desert” in the universe, devoid of much gas.\n\nWhat triggered the starburst in such a backwater galaxy? Based on simulations by Daniel Ceverino of the Center for Astronomy at Heidelberg University in Germany, and other team members, the observations suggest that less than 1 million years ago, Kiso 5639’s leading edge encountered a filament of gas. The filament dropped a large clump of matter onto the galaxy, stoking the vigorous star birth.\n\nDebra Elmegreen expects that in the future other parts of the galaxy will join in the star-making fireworks show. “Galaxies rotate, and as Kiso 5639 continues to spin, another part of the galaxy may receive an infusion of new gas from this filament, instigating another round of star birth,” she said.\n\nThe team’s results have been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nOther team members include Casiana Munoz-Tunon and Mercedes Filho (Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, Canary Islands), Jairo Mendez-Abreu (University of St. Andrews, United Kingdom), John Gallagher (University of Wisconsin-Madison), and Marc Rafelski (NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland).\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the telescope. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, conducts Hubble science operations. STScI is operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy in Washington, D.C.\n\nFor images and more information about Kiso 5639 and Hubble, visit:\n\n\n<a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/news/2016/23\" rel=\"nofollow\">hubblesite.org/news/2016/23</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/hubble\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasa.gov/hubble</a>\n\nImage credit: NASA, ESA, and D.

Lake Tengiz is the only large lake (1590 square kilometers, 615 square miles) in northern Kazakhstan. Through white wisps of cloud, the crew member photographed the 50 kilometer-long eastern shore of the lake, with its thin, winding islands and white beaches.\n\nThe islands and intervening waterways make a rich habitat for birds in this part of Asia. At least 318 species of birds have been identified at the lake; 22 of them are endangered. It is the northernmost habitat of the pink flamingo. The lake system is Kazakhstan’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it has been declared a RAMSAR wetland site of international importance.\n\nPart of the richness of area is its complex hydrology. Fresh water enters the system via the Kulanutpes River, so there are small lakes (lower right) full of fresh water. But in this closed basin, the water in the main lake (top) slowly evaporates, becoming salty. Winds stir up bigger waves on the main lake, dispersing sediment and salt and making the water a cloudier and lighter blue-green. (Another astronaut photograph shows the entire lake system, while this story provides more information.)\nThe strange shape of the islands is not easy to interpret. They may be drowned remnants of delta distributaries of the Kulanutpes River. Westerly winds probably have had a smoothing effect on the shorelines, especially in a shallow lake like Tengiz, which is only about 6 meters (20 feet) deep.\n\nThe lake has an exciting history for people who follow space exploration. In 1976, a Soyuz spacecraft landed in the lake near the north shore (top right). The capsule crashed through the ice and sank during an October snowstorm when temperatures were -22°C (-8°F). Because of low power, the capsule was unheated and the crew was feared lost. It was many hours before the airtight capsule was located and divers could attach flotation tanks to get the capsule to the surface. It was then dragged ashore across the ice by helicopter. The rescue effort took nine hours before the crew was able to safely exit the capsule.\n\nCredit: <b><a href=\"http://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> NASA Earth Observatory</a></b> \n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

UGC 4879 is an irregular dwarf galaxy — as the name suggests, galaxies of this type are a little smaller and messier than their cosmic cousins, lacking the majestic swirl of a spiral or the coherence of an elliptical.\nThis galaxy is also very isolated. There are about 2.3 million light years between UGC 4879 and its closest neighbor, Leo A, which is about the same distance as that between the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way.\nThis galaxy’s isolation means that it has not interacted with any surrounding galaxies, making it an ideal laboratory for studying star formation uncomplicated by interactions with other galaxies. Studies of UGC 4879 have revealed a significant amount of star formation in the first 4 billion years after the Big Bang, followed by a strange 9-billion-year lull in star formation that ended 1 billion years ago by a more recent re-ignition. The reason for this behavior, however, remains mysterious, and the solitary galaxy continues to provide ample study material for astronomers looking to understand the complex mysteries of star birth throughout the universe.\n\nImage credit: NASA/ESA\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

The stars comprising this spectacular spherical cluster are enriched with much higher proportions of metals — elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are curiously known as metals in astronomy — than stars found in similar clusters.\n\nA handful of these high-metallicity stars are also variable stars, meaning that their brightness fluctuates over time. NGC 6496 hosts a selection of long-period variables — giant pulsating stars whose brightness can take up to, and even over, a thousand days to change — and short-period eclipsing binaries, which dim when eclipsed by a stellar companion.\n\nThe nature of the variability of these stars can reveal important information about their mass, radius, luminosity, temperature, composition, and evolution, providing astronomers with measurements that would be difficult or even impossible to obtain through other methods.\n\nNGC 6496 was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop. The cluster resides at about 35,000 light-years away in the southern constellation of Scorpius (The Scorpion).\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt\nText credit: European Space Agency\n\nRead more: <a href=\"http://go.nasa.gov/1U2wqGW\" rel=\"nofollow\">go.nasa.gov/1U2wqGW</a>"},"o_width":"1041","o_height":"987","dateupload":"1464969657","lastupdate":"1469543426","datetaken":"2016-05-30 06:00:00","datetakengranularity":"0","datetakenunknown":"0","ownername":"NASA Goddard Photo and Video","iconserver":"5333","iconfarm":6,"views":"47239","tags":"metal star cluster hubble ngc6496","machine_tags":"","originalsecret":"ec6d444729","originalformat":"jpg","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"accuracy":0,"context":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/26829267114_2a84c285e7_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_t":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/26829267114_2a84c285e7_t.jpg","height_t":"95","width_t":"100","url_s":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/26829267114_2a84c285e7_m.jpg","height_s":"228","width_s":"240","url_q":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/26829267114_2a84c285e7_q.jpg","height_q":"150","width_q":"150","url_m":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/26829267114_2a84c285e7.jpg","height_m":"474","width_m":"500","url_n":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/26829267114_2a84c285e7_n.jpg","height_n":303,"width_n":"320","url_z":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/26829267114_2a84c285e7_z.jpg","height_z":"607","width_z":"640","url_c":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/26829267114_2a84c285e7_c.jpg","height_c":759,"width_c":"800","url_l":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/26829267114_2a84c285e7_b.jpg","height_l":"971","width_l":"1024","url_o":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/26829267114_ec6d444729_o.jpg","height_o":"987","width_o":"1041","pathalias":"gsfc"},{"id":"27174777682","owner":"24662369@N07","secret":"cf736a8fe3","server":"7363","farm":8,"title":"NAAMES Photo Essay","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"license":"4","description":{"_content":"Even with a major scientific expedition about to set sail one block away, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, hangs on to its centuries old New England charm.\n\n---\n\nThe <b><a href=\"http://naames.larc.nasa.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow\">North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study </a></b> (NAAMES) is a five year investigation to resolve key processes controlling ocean system function, their influences on atmospheric aerosols and clouds and their implications for climate.\n\nMichael Starobin joined the NAAMES field campaign on behalf of Earth Expeditions and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Office of Communications.

First proposed in 1976 by Mike Disney, the existence of LSB galaxies was confirmed only in 1986 with the discovery of Malin 1. LSB galaxies like UGC 477 are more diffusely distributed than galaxies such as Andromeda and the Milky Way. With surface brightnesses up to 250 times fainter than the night sky, these galaxies can be incredibly difficult to detect.\n\nMost of the matter present in LSB galaxies is in the form of hydrogen gas, rather than stars. Unlike the bulges of normal spiral galaxies, the centers of LSB galaxies do not contain large numbers of stars. Astronomers suspect that this is because LSB galaxies are mainly found in regions devoid of other galaxies, and have therefore experienced fewer galactic interactions and mergers capable of triggering high rates of star formation.\n\nLSB galaxies such as UGC 477 instead appear to be dominated by dark matter, making them excellent objects to study to further our understanding of this elusive substance. However, due to an underrepresentation in galactic surveys — caused by their characteristic low brightness — their importance has only been realized relatively recently.\n\nImage credit: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA image use policy.</a></b>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.
