# Getting started with flickr-app
flickr-app is a project designed to retrieve and display images using the flickr api.
This project is currently configured to get NASA images, but could easily be extended to retrieve and browse multiple users' photos.


## Prerequisites

You'll need access to the project on github: https://github.com/simonreid/flickr-app.git

## 1. Clone the app

Once you clone the git repository, use npm and bower to install dependencies.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/simonreid/flickr-app.git
  ```

  ```
  npm install
  ```

  ```
  bower install
  ```

  Peruse the files in the directory structure to familiarize yourself with the contents.

## 2. Run the app locally

Install the dependencies listed in the [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file to run the app locally.  
  ```
  npm start
  ```

Alternatively you can use:
  ```
  node server.js
  ```

View your app at: http://localhost:3000
